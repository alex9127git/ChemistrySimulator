# Rules of contributing:
1. Commits must be described enough and readable. If the commit won't be readable, it isn't good.
2. Issues should also be described. Look issue templates for more information on how to create good issues. Also, there is a good first issue for you to learn from.
3. Do **not** vandalize the project or bring it any harm, all of your changes must be justified. If you don't do this, you are a bad contributor.

That's all the rules. I'm actually doing the project myself, so the file exists only for me and the community guidelines. I know it's not ideal, but it's better than nothing.
